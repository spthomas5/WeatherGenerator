WeatherGenerator

A program written in Java that simulates a month of weather for a given location, and accordingly prints out the forecast as well as the best week to travel. Uses
text files wetwet.txt and wetdry.txt which stores probabilities that the next day is wet, based on whether the current day is wet or dry. 

This is the largest program I've ever written. It gave me experience with object-oriented programming and gave me the change to practice identifying small bugs 
within a large program.
