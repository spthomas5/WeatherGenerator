WeatherGenerator

A program written in Java that simulates a month of weather for a given location, and accordingly prints out the forecast as well as the best week to travel. Uses
text files wetwet.txt and wetdry.txt which stores probabilities that the next day is wet, based on whether the current day is wet or dry. 

Due to my limited experience, this was a fairly large program. It gave me experience with object-oriented programming and the chance to practice identifying small bugs within a large program.
